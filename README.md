# üìä Panic Attacks Data Analysis

üß† Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive visual analysis of patient data related to panic attacks, focusing on symptoms, triggers, severity scores, and demographic variables. The dashboard was built using Power BI, enabling interactive exploration of correlations between mental health factors and lifestyle habits such as sleep, alcohol intake, and medical history.

## üîç Objectives
To identify common symptoms among patients with panic attacks.

To assess the impact of lifestyle factors (e.g., sleep hours, drinks per week).

To compare age group responses (Adolescents vs Adults) to various trigger factors.

To determine variations in panic scores and frequency based on gender, medical history, and trigger causes.

## üìÅ Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following key attributes:

Column Name	        &     Description :
AGE	                     - Age of the patient,
GENDER     	             - Gender identity,
CAFFEINE_INTAKE	         - Caffeine consumption frequency,
ALCOHOL_CONSUMPTION	     - Drinks consumed per week,
SLEEP_HOURS         	   - Average hours of sleep,
PANIC_SCORE   	         - Computed panic score (severity),
PANIC_ATTACK_FREQUENCY	 - Number of panic attacks per defined period,
MEDICAL_HISTORY	         - Patient's psychological background (Anxiety, Depression, PTSD etc.),
CHEST_PAIN, TREMBLING, 
DIZZINESS, SWEATING, 
SHORTNESS_OF_BREATH	     - Boolean symptom indicators,
TRIGGER_REASON	         - Reported cause for panic attacks (e.g., Caffeine, PTSD),
DURATION_MINUTES	       - Duration of panic attack in minutes.

## üìà Key Dashboards & Visuals
### 1. Symptoms Analysis

Shows number of patients experiencing specific physical symptoms like dizziness, trembling, chest pain, sweating, and shortness of breath.

Highest observed symptom: Sweating (896 patients).

### 2. Lifestyle & Panic Attack Metrics

Sleep Hours vs Number of Patients.

Panic Attack Duration analysis shows peaks around 20 and 40 minutes.

Patients who consume more than 2 drinks/week show a steady distribution of panic-related cases.

### 3. Demographic Breakdown

Filters for:

Gender (Female, Male, Non-binary)

Trigger Reason (e.g., PTSD, Phobia)

Medical History (Anxiety, Depression)

Interactively narrows down cases by sleep deprivation, attack duration, and alcohol consumption.

### 4. Age Group vs Trigger Response

Visual comparison between Adolescents vs Adults based on different trigger factors:

Caffeine

Phobia

PTSD

Social Anxiety

Metrics shown:

Average Sleep Hours

Average Panic Score

Average Panic Attack Frequency

## üõ† Tools Used
Power BI for visual dashboards

Python Visual (enabled but not shown ‚Äî potential for future predictive modeling)

Excel/CSV assumed as data input source

## üìå Future Scope
Integrate machine learning models to predict panic scores based on input features.

Introduce time-series trends for longitudinal studies.

Expand on treatment analysis and therapy effectiveness.

## üôå Acknowledgements
Thanks to all open-source and health-based data providers whose anonymized datasets helped in building this analysis. This report aims to spread awareness about mental health insights through data.
